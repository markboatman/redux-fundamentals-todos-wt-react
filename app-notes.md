This project is based on the code for the redux tutorial example at: https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview

This is a create-react-app that uses redux, react-redux and redux-devtools-extension.

It is a todos app that uses redux to store the state of the todos and the state of the filters. It has two reducures or slices. the todosSlice and the filtersSlice. These are combined to produce the rootReducer in reducer.js. Filtering for the view on todos is done in TodoList.js.
